This project contains some of the programming exercises of the Deep Learning course (WS1920) offered by the [Pattern Recognition Lab (LME)](https://lme.tf.fau.de/) of the [Computer Science Department](https://www.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/) at University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (FAU).


In this repository, two basic IIR and FIR are implemented.
Also, under *./functions/* directory you can find implementation of some 
useful basic signals and transforms for digital signal processing.

The report *./Report_Soroosh Tayebi Arasteh.pdf/* is the reference for
the experiments and files, which is unfortunately only available in Persian language.

- **IIR Filter**: Using Butterworth approximation and Bilinear Transformation.


- **FIR Filter**: Using Kaiser window.
